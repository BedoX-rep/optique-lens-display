# Project Development Plan: Optique Lens E-Commerce Website

## Overview
This document outlines the steps and requirements to transform the current codebase into a full-featured e-commerce website using WooCommerce as the backend (for products, orders, inventory, etc.) and Supabase for user authentication and user data management.

---

## 1. Project Structure & Stack
- **Frontend:** React (current codebase, Vite, Tailwind CSS)
- **Backend (E-Commerce):** WooCommerce (WordPress plugin, REST API)
- **User Authentication:** Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage)
- **Hosting:** Vercel/Netlify (frontend), existing WordPress host (backend)

---

## 2. WooCommerce Integration
- Set up WooCommerce on a WordPress site (if not already done)
- Enable and configure WooCommerce REST API
- Generate API keys for secure access
- Integrate WooCommerce REST API in the frontend:
  - Product listing (GET /products)
  - Product details (GET /products/:id)
  - Cart management (local state or Supabase, sync with WooCommerce)
  - Checkout (POST /orders)
  - Order history (GET /orders?customer=)
  - Payment integration (use WooCommerce's built-in gateways)
- Handle product images, categories, filters, and search

---

## 3. Supabase Authentication
- Set up a Supabase project
- Configure Auth providers (email/password, OAuth, etc.)
- Integrate Supabase Auth in the frontend:
  - Sign up, login, logout, password reset
  - User profile management (Supabase table for user meta)
  - Protect routes/components (e.g., order history, account page)
- Store user-specific data (wishlists, addresses, etc.) in Supabase tables

---

## 4. Frontend Features to Build
- Home page (hero, featured products, categories)
- Product listing page (grid, filters, pagination)
- Product detail page (gallery, options, add to cart)
- Cart page (view, update, remove items)
- Checkout page (address, payment, order summary)
- Order confirmation page
- User account pages (profile, order history, addresses, password)
- Authentication pages (login, register, forgot password)
- Responsive navigation, footer, and mobile UX
- Toasts/alerts for actions (add to cart, login, etc.)
- Loading and error states

---

## 5. Backend/Integration Tasks
- WooCommerce API proxy (optional, for security)
- Webhooks for order status updates (optional)
- Sync user data between WooCommerce and Supabase (if needed)
- Secure API key management (env variables)

---

## 6. Additional Features (Optional)
- Product reviews/ratings
- Wishlist/favorites
- Newsletter integration (Mailchimp, etc.)
- Analytics (Google Analytics, etc.)
- SEO optimization (meta tags, sitemap)
- Accessibility improvements

---

## 7. DevOps & Deployment
- Environment variable management
- CI/CD setup (Vercel/Netlify)
- Staging and production environments
- Automated testing (unit, integration, e2e)

---

## 8. Project Management
- Set up GitHub project board/issues
- Define MVP and feature milestones
- Assign tasks and track progress

---

## 9. Documentation
- Update README with setup instructions
- Document API integration and environment variables
- Add code comments and usage examples

---

## 10. Security & Compliance
- HTTPS everywhere
- Secure API key storage
- GDPR compliance (privacy policy, cookie consent)

---

## Next Steps
1. Set up WooCommerce and Supabase projects
2. Integrate authentication and product APIs
3. Build out core e-commerce pages and flows
4. Test, refine, and deploy

---

This plan will guide the development of a robust, scalable, and user-friendly e-commerce website for Optique Lens.
